Devops - Ant - Session 2 



Based on the build file, we have few definitions

every build.xml file will have below.

1. project
2. targets
3. task

	- project <
		- a collection of targets (named)
		- built with dependency between the targets
		- one project per build file

	- targets
		- it has specific tasks
		- it can have dependnecy with other targets
			- not dependent on otther tasks/projects
		- every target can be appended wth attributes

	- tasks
		- example = eecho, copy create dir, execute, clean, compie etc etc 



=================== create a build.xml file

1. create a ant-builds directory and vim build.xml file in the ant-builds dir. add the below content

--------------
<project name="Pro1" default="step3">


        <target name="init">
                <echo message="Hello World!!!!"/>
        </target>


        <target name="step2" depends="init">
                <echo>
                        this is line 1
                        this is line 2
                        this is line 3
                </echo>

        </target>

        <target name="step3" depends="step2">
                <echo>
                        this is step 3.1
                        this is line 3.2
                        this is line 3.3
                </echo>

        </target>

</project>

----------------------------
2. now do "ant" command
	it will use the build.xml file and execute it as per target dependency.


3. we can call specfic targets

	ant <target name>

4. location from where we can see the list of tasks
	https://ant.apache.org/manual/tasklist.html

5. default seq of tasks
	- clean
	- init
	- compile
	- package(bzip/tar/jar/war>
	- distribute/deploy

Vagrant 

Virtualization concept


1. vmware, Citrix
steps to create a VM in VMWARE
- Vmware software - ESXi or workstation
	- licensed version
	- if esxi - huge system requirements
		- RAM, CPU, storage  etc etc
	- if Workstation 
		- min of 4Gb ram to create machine
- Download respective ISO files
	- Generally minimal install of Centos (close to 2Gb)
	- if you want Ubuntu (approx - 3gb)

- create a specific folder where you want to create the VM
	- all the VM related files will be stored in that folder
	- VMDK files etc

- go through the process of creating the VM on workstation/ESXi
	- various gui screens where you selct options and click next etc etc 

- installation time will take approx 30 Min

- you take a template and reuse it 

- increase the storage as needed
- destroy the VM if needed


==================

Over all turn around time to get a VM in real time environment is aprrox 3 to 6 hours, based on scenario (availability of all the resources)

DevOps - Virtualization - Session 1


- what is virtualization
	- amplifying of hardware resources 



Physical server is some thing like a Individual Duplex house.
Virtual servers is some thing like various flats in an appartment. 


If the hardware configuration is like below.

	- 8gb RAM
	- 4CPU
	- 500GB
 - A Physical server uses all the above resources and nothing is shared.

 - If virtualized, you can create multiple VMS and the above resources are shares as below.
	- VM1 = 512mb ram, 1VCPU, 30GB HD => Application 1 (256mb of ram)
	- VM2 = 512mb ram, 1VCPU, 30GB HD => application 2
	- VM3 = 512mb ram, 1VCPU, 30GB HD => Application 3
	- VM4 = 512mb ram, 1VCPU, 30GB HD => Application 4
	 
============================

Virtualization vendors

vmware
	- VMWARE Workstation (Desktop edition), this is a software.
	- VMWARE ESXI servers (Server edition), THis is a operating system. 

 
citrix (servers)
HyperV (Microsoft) (servers)

-------------------------------------
After completion of assignment 2 and 3 do the below steps
-------------------------------------

1. open a drive that has much free space.
	- create a folder -> Virtual-machines
	- go into the folder "Virtual-machines"
	- Create a Folder -> "VM1-Ubuntu-precise32"
	-  go into the folder
	- shift + right click in the folder
		- select the option "Open Command window here"

	- in the command prompt run the below command
		- vagrant init hashicorp/precise32
		- vagrant up
			- after the above command is executed successfully, 
			open virtual box and you can see a new vm created and running. 

		- download "Putty" 



------------------
Better practices of naming conventions
	- no spaces in the name
		- Folder 1 -> bad example
		- Folder-1 or folder_1
	- Include purpose in the name
		- 2009-pics
			- My_birthday_at_vizag
			- xyz_wedding_at_delhi_11_June



servers
- Purpose-#-location-domain

ex
 - web01ny.toi.com
 - web-01-ny.toi.com

 - app22sgdc.amazon.com

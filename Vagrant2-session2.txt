DevOps - Vagrant- session 2



the username and password to log into all the vagrant machines is the same


username = vagrant
password = vagrant


NOTE
	- by default vagrant connects on loop back address ... i.e. 127.0.0.1
	- port number 2222, 2200, 2201 etc etc


when you perform the below commands
	- vagrant init hashicorp/precise32
 	- vagrant up
  - one file "Vagrantfile" and one folder ".vagrant" are created.
	

******** Vagrantfile is very important. 
	It is the main configuration file of the virtual machine hashicorp/precise32



switch to "root" user

	sudo -i


root user is the admin user. he has full permissions on the machine and can do anything. 



1. once you loginto the machine for the first time....do the below command
	
	apt-get update
	

	this command will update all the software repo required in the system
	you perform this command only once .. the first time you login to the machine.




2. how to bring up a second vagrant machine

 - under virtual-machines, create a new folder
	- vm2_ubuntu_preice32


note - you should see 2 folders in the current location
	- vm1.ubuntu.precise32
	- vm2.ubuntu.precise32


 - go into this folder "vm2.ubuntu.precise32"
	- currently this folder should be empty
	
	- shift + right click 
	- open command prompt from here

 - perform the same commands again
	- vagrant init hashicorp/precise32
	- vagrant up
